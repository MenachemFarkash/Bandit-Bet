Rust Gambling Site

This is a gambling site based on the game Rust, built using React and Node.js. The site allows users to bet on various in-game events and outcomes, and potentially win big prizes.
Installation

To run the Rust Gambling Site, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from the official website.

Once you have Node.js installed, you can clone the repository to your local machine:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/rust-gambling-site.git

Then, navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

bash

cd rust-gambling-site
npm install

Running the Site

To start the site, you'll need to run two separate commands in different terminal windows.

In the first terminal window, start the Node.js server:

arduino

npm run server

In the second terminal window, start the React app:

arduino

npm run start

Once both commands are running, you should be able to access the site in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.
Usage

The Rust Gambling Site allows users to place bets on various in-game events and outcomes. Users can create an account, deposit funds, and place bets on different matches.

The site uses a virtual currency called "Rust Coins," which can be purchased with real money. Users can use Rust Coins to place bets and potentially win big prizes.
